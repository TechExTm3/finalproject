Project Intentions/Objective:

Problem Statement (What is the problem we are trying to solve?):  Defense Industries Inc. requires a streamlined and reliable way to  build and manage their AWS infrastructure. Currently, their process for  setting up and deploying cloud resources is manual and prone to errors,  leading to inefficiencies and potential misconfigurations. This project  aims to develop proof of concept website that provides Defense  Industries Inc. with pre-configured template files for AWS  infrastructure, making it easier for them to deploy resources  consistently and efficiently.

Objective:  To implement a proof of concept website that allows Defense Industries  Inc. to download AWS CloudFormation templates. These templates will be  used as a baseline for the customer to download and tailor to their  specific requirements for AWS resources, ensuring consistency and  reducing the potential for errors. The project will leverage AWS, Git,  and a CI/CD Pipeline using DevOps best practices to create a reliable  and scalable solution.

Who is the Customer? The customer is Defense Industries Inc.,  a company that requires efficient and consistent AWS infrastructure  deployment to support their operations and product showcases.

What is the Business Value?

Simplified Infrastructure Management:  The proof-of-concept website will provide Defense Industries Inc. with an example of how to provide easy access to pre-configured baseline AWS  templates.
Efficiency Gains: By using the  templates, the customer improves the time and effort required to build  and maintain AWS environments through the use of templates, allowing the  company to focus on their core business activities.
Consistency and Reliability:  By using standardized baseline templates, the company can ensure that  all deployments are consistent, reducing the risk of errors and  misconfigurations.
